    <h4>Delicious gooey burger</h2>
        <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step
            instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:

            Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread
            crumbs before forming the mixture into Â¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for
            six to eight minutes per side.

            Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top
            with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs, mix with your hands or a fork until well blended </li>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An
                instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
