    <h4>Delicious gooey lasagna</h2>
        <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how
            successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up
            more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for
            two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and
            legacy here.
